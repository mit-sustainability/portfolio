## [Climate Resiliency](https://sustainability.mit.edu/climate-action/build-resilience)

### [Flood Risk Climate Resiliency Dashboard](https://climate-resiliency.mit.edu/)
Collaborated with the [Urban Risk Lab](https://urbanrisklab.org/) and graduate students to model MITâ€™s flood risk under various sea level rise and storm surge scenarios, incorporating data on basement openings. The analysis includes seven flooding scenarios across historical, 2030, and 2070 timeframes.

Scenarios include:
