### Summary

The `all_scopes_ghg_inventory` pipeline aggregates MITâ€™s Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions data from `energize-mit` and Scope 3 GHG emissions from existing Scope 3 pipelines. This pipeline provides a comprehensive GHG inventory for each fiscal year, ensuring adherence to the GHG protocol. So far, the pipeline aggregates the following categories:

1. **Direct Emission**: Emissions generated by MIT's central utility plant from purchased gas and fuel, mobile fleet fuel, fugitive gas.
2. **Indirect Electricity**: Emissions associated with purchased electricity.
3. **Scope 3**:

| Scope 3 Category                        | Description                                          |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 3.1 Purchased Goods                     | Emissions associated with purchased goods and services           |
| 3.2 Capital Goods                       | Emissions from constructions and maintenance         |
| 3.3 Fuel and Energy Related Activities  | Includes upstream T&D loss, grid efficiency, gas leakage, etc. |
| 3.5 Waste                               | Emissions generated by waste processing              |
| 3.6 Business Travel                     | Emissions generated by travel activities             |
| 3.7 Commuting                           | Emissions from employee commuting                    |

### Data Sources

#### Internal

* **`ghg_entries_manual`**: Allows for manual input of GHG emissions for subcategories via a Quickbase application, automatically loading data to the platform.
* **`purchased_energy`**: Loaded from `energize-mit`, filtered to distinguish `CUP` and `Non-CUP` purchased energy, aligning with Scope 1 and 2 emissions shown in `energize-mit`.
* **`stg_fuel_energy_upstream`**: Emissions associated with upstream transmission and distribution (T&D) of fuel and electricity.

#### Upstream

* **Scope 3 Pipelines**: Includes pipelines for Purchased Goods, Business Travel, Construction, Waste, Fuel and energy-related activities, and Commuting.

### Processing

![GHG inventory](all_scopes.png#shadow)

1. **Sync Manual Entries from Quickbase Database**: The `ghg_manual_entries` is materialized whenever the Quickbase database is updated.
2. **Ingest `purchased_energy`**: Following `energize-mit` standards, the purchased energy is ingested from the `energy-cdr` table.
3. [**Fuel and Energy Related Activities**](fuel_and_energy_related.md): Process emissions data related to upstream T&D and other fuel activities.
4. **Aggregate Categories**: Combine all categories into the `stg_ghg_inventory` table.
5. **Snapshot Creation**: Take a snapshot of the `stg_ghg_inventory` table to track changes.
6. **Final Inventory Table**: Create the `final_ghg_inventory` table to display the latest complete fiscal year GHG emissions by category.
